How did this journey begin — the one “Between Walls and Pixels”?

My path into real estate began with interior design and expanded when I worked as a real estate agent in Greece. I wasn’t just finding properties — I was helping people see potential where others saw problems.

When I bought my own home, I went through the full experience: the excitement, the stress, and the transformation of creating a space that truly felt mine.

At the same time, I was always drawn to technology — a world of constant evolution. I never stopped learning. Six months ago, I found something that combined my love for real estate with my passion for digital innovation: web design.

That was the missing piece. I started from scratch, without a technical background, and slowly taught myself how to translate my hands-on experience into functional tools. Two seemingly different worlds — the architecture of space and the architecture of information — began to speak the same language. And then, new **possibilities** started to unfold.
